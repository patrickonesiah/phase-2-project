<h1>Project Title: Narrative Grove</h1>

<h2>Project Description</h2>
I developed a single-page web application that empowers parents to document their child's development, progress, and learning journey. Users can create, edit, and view stories. The technology stack includes React, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The backend is hosted on Render, while the frontend is hosted on Netlify. I opted for React to leverage its component-based structure, allowing for a modular and organized development approach.

<h2>What issues have I faced?</h2>
Faced a few challenges during this project was part of the journey.

Firstly, determining which feature should be a component was a puzzle. I realized that if a feature repeated across most pages, turning it into a component was the way to go. For instance, the like button is displayed both in the list of stories and when a user reads a single story.

Secondly, structuring the data in the database posed its own challenge. I initially envisioned a database with users linked to stories, but I'm still figuring out the ideal data structure. For now, I've kept it simple, focusing on rendering the stories.

Lastly, I encountered a hiccup when I couldn't build my web application due to warnings in Netlify. Warnings included unused variables, unassigned arrays, and missing dependencies. Addressing these issues became a key part of the project's refinement process.


<h2>What else would you like to see in this project?</h2>
A future feature I envision implementing is a login system. This would enable logged-in users to view the stories they have written. Additionally, I aim to allow users to invite their loved ones, such as grandparents or cousins, to read these stories. The invitation could be facilitated via email, and I plan to provide a sign-up option for new users to join the web application.

<h2>What have I learned from this project?</h2>
During this project, I gained insights into the most commonly used React Hooks, understanding how to pass props between components, and mastering the navigation flow of a single-page web application as it transitions between various pages. Additionally, I learned about the process of connecting my GitHub repository to Netlify, gaining insights into continuous development practices.
